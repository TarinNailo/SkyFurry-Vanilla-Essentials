# Contributing

SVE is actively looking for testers and contributers! Please use the issues tab to report any bugs or problems with the modlist so they can be tracked and resolved over time. For contributers you can either suggest new additions to the list and I will add them as I am able, or you can make a pull request with the information needed for new mods as outlined below.

## Suggesting a new mod

Contributing to the Modlist itself is straight forward. You can suggest a new mod to be added by creating an [Issue](https://github.com/TarinNailo/SkyFurry-Vanilla-Essentials/issues) labeled with the "New Mod" label with the title of the post being New Mode: 'name of mod'. 

If you are familiar with how wabbajack works and want to add one yourself to the modlist please create a pull request with the .meta of the mod to be added and in the description put any information about the mod, why you think it should be added, and where in the mod order it should go. Any NOMATCH_INCLUDE files should also be added to the pull request. Once I have added the mod to the wabbajack and compiled a new installer I will close the PR and the issue.

### Bugs and Issues
